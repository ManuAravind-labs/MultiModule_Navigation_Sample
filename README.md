# MultiModule_Navigation_Sample
Build a scalable multi-module application on Android


When we try to build A Multi-module application on Android, navigation is a problem that we are usually facing. For example, we are creating an application having 25 modules and it is still growing. We can go through multiple approaches Deep linking and NavigationComponents etc.

Deep-links :
Disadvantages :
As long as more modules are created we have to create more deep links and at the end will become messy
Does not support parceable data through Deep-link 

NavigationComponent
Disadantages: 
In the recent update, NavigationComponent allows multi module apps.But it is mainly focus on fragments 

So we need to go with different approach
